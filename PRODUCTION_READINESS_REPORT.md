## ⚠️ Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

These warnings do not affect functionality and can be addressed post-launch:

1. **41 ESLint Warnings**: Mostly unused variables and TypeScript `any` types in non-critical components
2. **1 Deprecation Warning**: `url.parse()` deprecation (from Next.js internal, no action needed)
3. **React Hook Dependencies**: Missing dependencies in optional components (EasterEggs, PopupManager, etc.)

**Impact**: NONE - These are in non-critical features and don't affect payment flow
