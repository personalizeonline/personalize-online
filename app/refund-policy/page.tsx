                <h2>Why We Don't Offer Refunds</h2>
                <p>
                  Personalize Online creates custom songs based on your specific inputs (name, category, personal details).
                  Each song is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Instantly Generated:</strong> Created based on your personalization</li>
                  <li><strong>Unique to You:</strong> Includes your name in the lyrics and is tailored to your story</li>
                  <li><strong>Immediately Delivered:</strong> Sent to your email as soon as it's ready</li>
                  <li><strong>Non-Returnable Digital Product:</strong> Like other custom digital content, it cannot be "returned"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Once a song is generated and delivered, it is yours to keep. We cannot "undo" the creation or
                  delivery of your personalized content.
